# PianoNet
## About
PianoNet is a deep neural network for generating piano compositions. The model architectures are similar to the dilated convolutional networks described in [WaveNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03499), with modifications for being able to handle piano midi data.

For an example performance generated by a medium-sized model, visit PianoNet's [SoundCloud page](https://soundcloud.com/tom-angsten/pianonet-generative-neural-net-performance-in-style-of-bach-1)

## Features
* Build a generative piano model in minutes, train in a few days on a modern laptop
* Framework for easy experimentation using file-based interface
* Clear logging of training results for tracking of training history
* Object-oriented abstraction of data components for painless dataset creation from raw midi files

## Installing
1. Clone this repository to a local directory, cd into this directory
2. Create a [python virtualenv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) in this directory
3. Activate the virtualenv using `source ./venv/bin/activate`
4. Run `python setup.py install`
5. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt'

## Example Usage
