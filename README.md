# PianoNet
## About
PianoNet is a deep neural network for generating piano compositions. The model architectures are similar to those described in [WaveNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03499), with modifications for being able to handle piano midi data.

For an example performance generated by a medium-sized model, visit this model's [SoundCloud page](https://soundcloud.com/tom-angsten/pianonet-generative-neural-net-performance-in-style-of-bach-1)

## Features
* Build a generative piano model in minutes, train in a few days on a modern laptop
* Framework for easy experimentation using file-based interface
* Clear logging of training results for tracking of training history
* Object-oriented abstraction of data components for painless dataset creation from raw midi files

More to come soon on how to run your own experiments!
